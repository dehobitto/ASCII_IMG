# ASCII_IMG C# .NET Core
So, it's just a basic program that converts Image/Video/Camera to an **ASCII** Characters in *realtime*.

## Why again?
You probably saw a lot of videos about this, but when I wanted to use something like that on C# I found only a few solutions, without repository or explainings, and I have not seen realtime video conversion ethier.

## Cool stuff
You can change resolution in realtime, just scale the console itself, It will automaticly change the resolution either, but its causing some artifacts outside the ASCII art.
